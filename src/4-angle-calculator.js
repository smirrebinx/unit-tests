export const angleCalculator = (turns) => {

};

// Added turns * 360 to pass the test
// The angleCalculator function takes the number of turns as input. 
// It then multiplies the number of turns by 360 to calculate the 
// corresponding angle in degrees. The result is returned as the 
// output of the function.
